# Linear-Regression-Interactive-Visualization
An interactive visualization of the linear regression algorithm using OpenGL to help understand how the algorithm works. The program uses as an example the case of searching a line that satisfies a 2D-points' Dataset.

# Prerequisites:
1. Runs on Windows With OpenGL >= 1.0
2. CodeBlocks

# Compilation/Build:
1. Install CodeBlocks
2. Open LinearRegression.cbp
3. Run the program

# About This Program
This programs uses the Gradient Descent Linear Regression To Find a Linear Model that represents a data-set of user defined 2D-Points.

# Usage:
1. Define the 2D-Points DataSet By Clicking on the right position for each point on the left box.
2. Define the Learning Rate for Linear Regression GD.
3. Define Maximum number of epochs and click "Start" to start a timer loop linear regression visualization.
4. Click "Stop" to break the linear regression loop.
5. Click One-Step to advance by a single iteration.
6. Click "Clear Points" to start a new experiment using another data set.
